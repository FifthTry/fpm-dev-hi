How many people can guess `gu` stands for\nGujarati and not some African language? What have we really saved by writing `gu`,\ninstead of writing \"gujarati\" which has to be written precisely once in the \npackage which is probably going to have tens or thousands of words? \n\nWe have a few problems here. One we must ensure the language names are exactly the\nsame, we all call it either \"Gujarati\" or \"gujarati\". This is because we can then\neasily re-use translations etc, standardisation is good in general.\n\nWe can use the \"ISO Language Name\" column as shown in the \n[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes) (or find out\nwhere did they get the actual data from). They have mapped more than one names to\nsame code in a few cases, which I feel is actually a good thing, we can be more \nprecise in language name, honour the preference of the author, we are interested\nin the code, which we will get.\n\nSo this is our first decision. We will proper case also, so `language: Gujarati`\nas it is proper noun, and not `language: gujarati`.\n\nThen the other problem is how to show the name of language in language detail\npage in a form native speakers of that language can understand, so \"ગુજરાતી\" we \nshould show. But the translation status page we should show probably both ગુજરાતી and\nGujarati.",

For translation we may want to use the translation of \na dependency instead of the original package, and while doing so we would need to \nbe able to rename and keep using the same name.\n\nNext we also have to add `language` in `fpm::Package`, and ensure that key is set\nif current package is `translation-of` some \"original package\".

Are we allowing `x/index.ftd` to be referred to by `x`? No. Our\n`index.ftd` is only special at package root level, and not at individual folder \nlevel, we follow `x.ftd` and `x/y.ftd` convention and do not fall back to \n`x/index.ftd`, `x/y.ftd` as say node etc do. There are advantages to fall back, eg\nwhole of `/x/*` is in a folder `x`, this leads to some simplicity, eg if you want\nto ignore that path, you have to no ignore `x/` folder as well as `x.ftd` file.\n\nWe also have complications around import path in ftd documents vs file paths on\ncommand line. If you want to import `x.ftd` you write `-- import: x`, without the\nextension. Does that mean when you want to refer to `x.ftd` anywhere in FPM context\nit must be `x`? Like on command line if you want to add tracking on `x.ftd` or sync\n`x.ftd` do you use `x` or `x.ftd`? \n\nWe can have a rule, if only ftd file is meaningful in any context, eg in import\nstatement, you can not import a `.txt` file, but you can track `.txt` file, so if\nonly `.ftd` is allowed for something we use the path without `.ftd` extension and\nany file can be passed we use the extension.\n\nWe can also standardise on file vs document terminology.

We see
that the English FPM package was last modified on <code>2021-12-29T20:55</code> and has 13
documents.</p>
<p>We see that it is translated in 2 languages, <code>hi</code>, 2 letter ISO 639-1 code for
Hindi, and <code>gu</code>, Gujarati. For each language we see how many of original 13
documents are “Partially? translated but <strong>Never Marked</strong> up to date”, “<strong>Missing</strong>
(translation not yet started)”, “Translated was done at some point by is now
<strong>Out-Dated</strong>”, and “Up-to Date”. We also see when was any of the packages last
modified.</p>
<p>This gives a very good overall picture of the project. We plan to add word counts
too as progress of library work, which is what FPM packages contain often, are
better tracked by word counts, not file counts.</p>
<p>We have to try to strike a balance between too much data making the UI confusing vs
too little data leading to people having to click around more than necessary to get
the information at a glance. We will have to do usability testing, engage with
proper UX people etc. But its a good start, quite happy with it.</p>

to dig deep and see more details for any language. For this we have Language Detail
Page, which has the URL: <code>&lt;domain-of-translation&gt;/FPM/translation-status/</code>. Not
too fond of naming the page “Language Detail Page” but the URL containing
“translation-status” when we already have another page called “Translation Status
Page”. But I like the URLs too, its technically translation status of that
language, but what do call it then, “Translation Status Of Translation Page”? That
would be monstrosity, “Language Detail Page” seems obvious.</p>

<p>Which means if they are not periodically rebuilt, or better built in some event
drive way (we know what package we depend on, what if we also knew what packages
depend on me, and I could tell each of them hey I have changed!, or maybe we can
still have a central repository, or maybe even say
<a href="https://github.com/orbitdb/orbit-db">orbit-db</a> etc which only keeps track of which
package was last built at what time, so we can auto refresh the entire page or
just the <code>translation-status.html</code> file.</p>
<p>Other approach could be we do client side fetching of <code>FPM.ftd</code> file, so when you
go to Translation Status Page, we show the last built version but we then download
<code>FPM.ftd</code> for each of the translations, and recompute the data.</p>
<p>I am not too happy with the frontend approach, every single visitor will
re-download everything, think about the global warming people, FPM is trying to be
network resilient, if we create multi plantery civilisations, HTTP based lets just
fetch what we want when we want won’t work, and such federated, change when needed,
show stale but refresh etc approaches would be needed.</p>

<p>We will soon create a “document interface” for FPM Package Info, which will include

First is the
tried and tested, i18n approach, say we use <a href="https://projectfluent.org">Mozilla’s
Fluent</a>. We can define special strings we have in our
source code, and we invest in comprehensive translation so no one has need to
improve it (meaning it can not be done by writing FTD files, you must recompile
<code>fpm</code>).</p>
<p>I am not fond of that approach, primarily because while we can do that for strings
we know about, but what about themes and other kind of content people create? Say
a theme for book (document interface) will have terms like “table of content”, how
to centrally translate such information so that each user of that document
interface in that language doesn’t have to keep deciding how to translate things.</p>
<p>We need to think more about this.</p>

short versions, like <code>integer</code> instead of <code>int</code>, or <code>language</code> instead of <code>lang</code>,
since we believe things are written once and read many many times, and we have
immense capability in getting confused. How many people can guess <code>gu</code> stands for
Gujarati and not some African language? What have we really saved by writing <code>gu</code>,
instead of writing “gujarati” which has to be written precisely once in the
package which is probably going to have tens or thousands of words?</p>
<p>We have a few problems here. One we must ensure the language names are exactly the
same, we all call it either “Gujarati” or “gujarati”. This is because we can then
easily re-use translations etc, standardisation is good in general.</p>
<p>We can use the “ISO Language Name” column as shown in the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes">Wikipedia</a> (or find out
where did they get the actual data from). They have mapped more than one names to
same code in a few cases, which I feel is actually a good thing, we can be more
precise in language name, honour the preference of the author, we are interested
in the code, which we will get.</p>
<p>So this is our first decision. We will proper case also, so <code>language: Gujarati</code>
as it is proper noun, and not <code>language: gujarati</code>.</p>
<p>Then the other problem is how to show the name of language in language detail
page in a form native speakers of that language can understand, so “ગુજરાતી” we
should show. But the translation status page we should show probably both ગુજરાતી and
Gujarati.</p>

information, should we allow both somehow? Say <code>language: Gujarati | ગુજરાતી</code>, we
will ignore the part after <code>|</code>, so that can be used as some sort of description
about the translation.</p>
<p>This got me into thinking if we must have a requirement that there can be only one
translation in one language, since if not this allows us to also explain what is
happening, so we have syntax, but do we have a need?</p>
<p>This got me into thinking what if there was a book “Rust Programming Language” and
someone translated it into “Rust Programming Language for Advance Haskell
Programmer”, it will remain in English, but the audience has changed, advance
Haskell programmers probably do not need such a laborious, long explanation, maybe
their book would be just a 10 page book instead of the 100 (random guess) page
current book?</p>
<p>After all the purpose of translation is to make some work accessible to a
population who wanted to read it but could not because of language barrier. But
isn’t a book written in too much (or too little) technical detail a language
barrier itself? Can you read a book written for absolute beginner of a topic if you
are in advanced stage, and vice versa? Can these two people really talk to each
other meaningfully? Isn’t there is a need for a translation there?</p>
<p>And consider this also: say I am describing the strict specification of what FPM
does, shouldnt there be a document like this? Which assumes you know everything,
and you are only interested in exact description of precise behaviour of what FPM
does? Of course that document must exist. But is that just a document? It must be
a package right? And then we have the “end user documentation” of FPM. Isn’t that
just a “translation” of the formal spec?</p>
<p>Conclusion: we will allow <code>language: Gujarati | ગુજરાતી</code> syntax. First part must be
language name as per ISO 639-1. But when allowing or disallowing we will use the
entire value of <code>language:</code> key. So you can not have two translations with
<code>language: Gujarati | ગુજરાતી</code>, but you can have one with
<code>language: Gujarati | ગુજરાતી</code> and other with <code>language: Gujarati | ગુજરાતી  (simplified)</code>.</p>

<p>Was reviewing the latest PR done by Arpita, and this thought occurred to me: we
currently do, what Jest popularised as “<a href="https://jestjs.io/docs/snapshot-testing">snapshot
testing</a>”, we create “snapshots” of
generated HTML files, and ensure they do not change.</p>
<p>I find HTML a bit noisy, reviewing change in generated HTML is not fun. Further
there is a question of coverage - not all features of <code>fpm</code> could have been used
in the <code>.ftd</code> file, maybe it is barebones, and when someone uses realistic <code>.ftd</code>
files, maybe things would not go as expected.</p>

<p>Not sure. The thought that’s coming to me is in such cases we need not necessarily
store the <code>.html</code> file, we just stored the corresponding dynamic context, <code>fpm.ftd</code>

smaller diffs. I guess I just trying to reduce the amount of code review I have to

folder during build, and how we can sometime download just the <code>FPM.ftd</code> for an
FPM package instead of downloading the entire package <code>.zip</code> file. It sounded like
a great idea, and Arpita implemented it right away, and she did one better, she
included some extra data also in the <code>FPM.ftd</code> file.</p>
<p>This opens up interesting possibilities, now we can include all sorts of generated
package meta data and make it part of the published <code>FPM.ftd</code> file. We can show
number of files or word count of the package, we can include LICENSE, even sitemap,
latest snapshot versions etc etc. We can anticipate a lot of need, and most of the
“metadata” needs of <code>fpm</code> can be satisfied by putting data in <code>FPM.ftd</code>.</p>
<p>So currently we also publish <code>/FPM/index.html</code>, which is generated out of <code>FPM.ftd</code>
file in the package. With this idea, of making lot more data available to <code>FPM.ftd</code>
that becomes even more interesting.</p>
<p>We will create <code>FPM/info.ftd</code> file, which will have all the <code>FPM.ftd</code> data
available, and would be rendered in <code>FPM/index.html</code>, so we can have a proper

can get the package source from, where it is presumably being maintained, say
Github, or the actual built and deployed URL where things are hosted. Both contain
<code>FPM.ftd</code> file.</p>
<p>Consider translation status. Say the original package is trying to create a status
dashboard for all translation packages, showing like how many documents in that
translation are upto date, missing etc. To compute this information <code>fpm</code> can
download the latest version of each translation package, but this information is
coming from where source repo, like Github, so <code>zip</code> may point to <code>main</code> branch’s
<code>.zip</code> file.</p>
<p>If we trusted the <code>main</code> branch the problem is end users are viewing the
translation status page, and they may see, oh this package is 100% translated in
so and so language, but when the click on the link they may find that its not so,
as there is a possibility that things have landed in <code>main</code> branch, but not yet
built and published. This can happen because say deploy failed due to some reason.</p>
<p>So it seems that the <code>&lt;package-name&gt;/FPM.ftd</code> should be considered source of truth
when its materially different from <code>&lt;package-repo&gt;/FPM.ftd</code>.</p>

the content of the package. So much better than the earlier approach of searching
for the package in the package repo, and hoping the repo index page links to the
published version somewhere.</p>
<p>Arpita pointed out that one of the cool side effect of this design (the fact that
<code>FPM.ftd</code> is now downloadable, without having to download the entire FPM package)
is that for many cases we will not have to download full package, eg when
specifying translations, when a FPM package is specifying the translations, we only
specify the package name, the actual language of the package is part of <code>FPM.ftd</code>
meta-data of that package, and she used to have to download the entire FPM package
zip file just to get the language (so she can show it in the translation dropdown).</p>

rolling, it would be good to import a the project we are targeting, convert them
to a FPM package and publish on some temporary URL for demo purpose.</p>
<p>But we do not want Google to index our page. We can do robots.txt and block
indexing, but its even better to add canonical URL so Google gives proper credit to
original URL for improving their search ranking.</p>

support</a> yesterday. Till now all
HTML files generated by FPM used to have title <code>ftd</code>, after this pull request the
title is picked from content of FTD document being process right now.</p>
<p>In FTD we have a concept called <a href="/ftd/common/"><code>region</code></a>, any FTD element can use
region to express their semantic meaning. The idea is to let screen readers, search
engines etc discover what is the heading, or what is the role played by different
elements, so they can skip over things and focus on main content etc.</p>
<p>We have regions like <code>h0</code>, <code>h1</code> and so on for headings of different levels. To
compute the title we look for the first text block with <code>h0</code> region, if its not
found we look at first <code>h1</code> and so on. If no region is set then we look for first
text element. If that is also missing then we assume the <code>document-id</code> (relative
file path of the file being process with respect to package root, without the
<code>.ftd</code> extension) is the title.</p>

than other systems where theming is well defined, you always know what you are

Winamp supports Winamp “Skins”, which only works Winamp, you cant use Winamp skin
with your Wordpress blog for example[1], with FPM you all sorts of UI, music

cross portability across all of them “as long as it makes sense”: follows the same

would be lunacy my friend. Just import the FPM package for the Winamp theme,
pass the data that Winamp would have passed it (if we were living in the world
where people are not, you know, insane – creating UI in platform after
platform, even more insane where UI of one “framework” on same platform can’t
use UI of another frame, I am looking at you JavaScript, with your framework
pared – and using FPM for example), and now you blog post contains always
refreshing, true, intractable Winamp screen. FPM makes it possible. Why would
you not?</p>

<p>Arpita just finished translation UI (and basic translation feature in general). I
started writing update about translation feature on Journal, but I feel this
deserves a video update. Let’s do a bit more polish, create different states,
currently all translations are missing, do a bit of UI polish and towards the end
of the day create the video.</p>
<p>In the meanwhile you can <a href="https://arpita-jaiswal.github.io/vivekanand-gu/">check it out here</a>.
Notice the links in the header, they take you to respective pages in other

<p>Super awesome job 🙌, Arpita!</p>

design. We do not want a single central infrastructure in FPM like they have in
other languages, eg <code>crates.io</code> for Rust or <code>npmjs.com</code> for Javascript and so on.
Centralisation has many problems, censorship becomes easy, single point of attack
for bad players, difficulty with confidentiality (what if you have some
information you do not want to leave your company VPN etc), bureaucracy (you can
not get a new feature on crates.io till you go through whatever hoops that there
to work with their team: I am sure they are very responsive etc, but they cant be
as responsive as your own self hosted repo, that you can tweak and deploy hourly
if you wanted to).</p>
<p>But for FPM, centralisation is especially a problem: other package managers only
distribute packages to be downloaded once at build time, when you are doing a
deploy, you will download the <code>.zip</code> file from package repository, and won’t
download again till another dependency is added or version changes. No end user
goes to <code>crates.io</code>/<code>nmpjs.com</code> etc.</p>
<p>FPM packages on the other hand are actual websites. So FPM repository is used by
all end users, and all your site traffic goes to your <code>fpm-repo</code>. One single
website or a company can not host the entire Internet (live traffic, not like
<code>Archive.org</code>).</p>
<p>We also envisage that <code>fpm-repo</code> will be giving differential features, some may
give load balanced deployment with support for Edge caching, some other may focus
on Math related computation etc. FPM and FTD has a lot of dynamic features, and
that means there is a lot of play in features offered, pricing and business models
and so on.</p>

<p>When using <code>fpm build</code> locally vs when using it for GitHub Pages hosted site there
is a difference. Locally we build everything in <code>.build</code> folder directly, and URLs
are /x/ for <code>x.ftd</code> file. But when hosting a site on Github Pages, without using
custom domain, the URL GitHub Pages gives us is <code>&lt;account-name&gt;.github.io/&lt;repo-name&gt;/x/</code>.
So every URL is prefixed by <code>/&lt;repo-name&gt;/</code>.</p>
<p>One idea that came to me was we use HTML’s <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/base"><code>base</code>
tag</a>, set the
base to either <code>/</code> on local or <code>/repo-name/</code> in Github Action for GitHub Pages,
and use relative URLs in <code>ftd</code> files. Have implemented this feature.</p>
<p>Other idea that came to me after implementing first solution: we create a folder
<code>&lt;repo-name&gt;</code> in <code>.build</code> folder, so when browsing locally we get the same path as
when browsing remotely, all URLs that we put in <code>ftd</code> files have <code>/&lt;repo-name&gt;/</code>
prefix.</p>
<p>Not sure the pros and cons of the two. Former is implemented already so thats one
pro. Later somehow feels cleaner to me. Not yet sure.</p>
<p>If you are using GitHub Pages, build your files with <code>fpm build --base=/</code> locally
and <code>fpm build --base=/repo-name/</code> in your GitHub Actions, and use remove use <code>x/</code>
instead of <code>/x/</code> when creating links in your ftd files.</p>

test suite on Linux), but we never tried it on Windows so far.</p>
<p>Ganesh has been trying to use FPM on windows, and he had to install Visual Studio
and Rust to build it. He had Windows 7, 32-bit based really old laptop, and turns
out Visual Studio itself doesn’t support Windows 7/32-bit combination. He upgraded
his laptop’s hard disc to SSD, and updated to Windows 11, and got Rust to compile
FPM. We came across SQLite related issue, some SQLite DLL was required, so I
<a href="https://github.com/FifthTry/fpm/commit/429e957aa17ec8291fc7dc1dd102676764a3ce28">switched to bundled
SQLite</a>,
and it finally compiled.</p>
<p>But the <code>fpm build</code> did not work! It did not find any file. Turns out our code had
hard coded <code>/</code> in a bunch of places, Shobhit found and <a href="https://github.com/FifthTry/fpm/pull/26/files">fixed some of those
issues</a>, and after this <code>fpm build</code>
is working for Ganesh.</p>
<p>Shobhit basically followed <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/dev-environment/rust/setup">Microsoft Documentation about Rust
setup</a> and it
just worked. Cool thing is the compiled exe works even on machines without Rust,
of course, and Visual Studio (was not sure about this) installed.</p>
<p>We have not yet created any automation for creating exe every time a new release on
FPM is created, we will figure out this soon (Jan end timeframe). For now if you
need latest FPM exe, shout out to Shobhit on or discord channel and he will do it
for you.</p>
<p>We have not yet run our test suite on Windows actually, only verified basic feature
manually. We use <a href="///www.fifthtry.com/fbt/"><code>fbt</code></a> for testing, a testing
framework for CLI applications, we have developed at FifthTry, but it too doesn’t
support Windows yet.</p>

and I kind of agree with this sentiment:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I find it little disconcerting that a “modern” language has such an arcane
restriction about Unicode filenames.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Reviewing the <a href="https://rust-lang.github.io/rfcs/2457-non-ascii-idents.html"><code>non-ascii-idents</code></a>
RFC that Steve Klabnik linked to, I kind of only agree with only of the drawback
listed there:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Homoglyph attacks are possible.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Overall I believe we should go ahead with it. Rust has decided to despite the
issues so should we.</p>
<p>What would it entail? What would we have to do? We should support unicode in FPM
package names, as well as identified (component, variable, record names etc) in
FTD. Any character is allowed in names? No, <a href="http://www.unicode.org/Public/7.0.0/ucd/DerivedCoreProperties.txt"><code>ID_Start</code> and <code>ID_Continue</code> character
classes are defined in
Unicode</a>, so
all our “id”s should accept allow them (minis keywords reserved by FTD itself, eg
<code>record</code>).</p>

package naming, so wanted to write down my thoughts about them. Currently all
packages in FTM are distributed via Github. In short future ~ Jan-Feb 2022
timeframe we should also have <code>fpm-repo</code> that can be used for publishing packages.</p>
<p><code>fpm-repo</code> is going to be self host-able, as well as SAAS version. But the
distinction, if something is self hosted or on some package repository should not
exposed to users of package, so authors should easily move their package from
self-hosting to SAAS or back without breaking anything.</p>
<p>Moving from Github to <code>fpm-repo</code> should ideally also be seamless, but currently we
expect the package to specify <code>repo: github</code>. We also have <code>domain</code> setting for
each package, so domain name can be considered as part of a package, if we did that
then the published version of package may include some information about how to
fetch the source version of package, so in dependency it would be enough to give
the package name, (with domain name as part of package name).</p>
<p>I was going in another direction, but I think I like this decision even more.</p>

<p>After <a href="https://github.com/FifthTry/ftd/commit/0ce8a3cc3a115a0dca06b9d06824641bc4bc42a4">fixing font issue in
FTD</a>,
finally we got FPM working with custom Google Fonts (any font for that matter
should work).</p>
<p>We had an easy way to fix and a “correct” way to fix it. The problem is Font is not
a simple file. Since we have a lot of languages, we can not embed symbols for all
characters in all languages in a single font file, as that would become a large
file and would slow down websites (and waste CPU/battery/bandwidth). Similarly many
fonts design regular font face, italics, bold etc separately, previously people
used to just algorithmically slant the characters or make the font bold by
thickening the lines, but for best effect font designers create custom design for
one or more/all characters for each font style. So we can not put regular, bold,
italics etc in one file as well, as that too will be wasteful.</p>
<p>So CSS lets you specify multiple font files, for different unicode range and font
face etc, and let browser download the font they need based on the content of the
current page.</p>
<p>So coming back to problem: we only had place to store one font file, which clearly
won’t cut it. The easy way to fix was suggested by Sourabh to allow people to pass
URL of CSS file, eg Google Font recommends something like this:</p>

used. So we can ask people to give us CSS file URL as font file, and we can include
it in the page. This does solve the problem, its easy. But it has a problem: it
allows people to now provide arbitrary CSS file, there is no way to check the
content of the target file to ensure it only contains <code>@font-face</code> declarations, it
can contain any CSS, and it becomes a way for people to include CSS in FTD files.</p>
<p>This is a problem because FTD is designed with multiple target support, we
currently compile FTD to HTML/CSS/JS, but in future we will compile to Swift code
or Kotlin etc for mobile devices, or C code for ncurses based terminal UI support
and so on. We are taking inspiration from CSS, the attributes for example, but
that’s it, those attributes will have equivalent in Android/nCurses etc, or we will
try to degrade gracefully.</p>
<p>If we allow CSS then suddenly our layout kernels can be misused to give arbitrary
layouts, and suddenly FTD files won’t be compatible with our future FTD rendering
targets. We believe CSS is over designed etc, and so is JS. We can create a browser
from scratch without CSS/JS overhead, which is capable of rendering FTD files, so
even for browsers we do not need the whole thing. We can maybe even use canvas API
to use such custom rendering even for current HTML based browsers.</p>
<p>So we can not include CSS. What we did instead of looked at <code>@font-face</code> from CSS,
and created an equivalent for the same:</p>

<p>Package Interface, and package aliasing are features that we are working towards to
solve this problem. So if you include the package as a dependency and overwrite it
transitive dependencies to use a package you provide instead of the package the
original package author requested (as long as the substituted package confirms to
the package interface of the package being substituted), we achieve component
visual harmonisation.</p>

multiple documents from another package in the table of content. The challenge in
this case is “re-levelling” document “roles” like “Chapter” or “Section” and so on.
In original package the subtree we want to include may be just a section, but in
current package we may want to import it a chapter level.</p>
<p>If the documents know about their role, eg the title of a document was “section
1: introduction”, it will read wrong if it’s included as a chapter. Also chapter
numbering must not be part of the document.</p>
<p>One thought for this is to define variables like <code>fpm.role</code> and <code>fpm.role-numner</code>,
and asking documents to use these variables instead of making assumptions about
their roles etc.</p>

<p>Since Monday, I and Shobhit has been spending lot of time discussing how best to
allow people to include content from package into another.</p>
<p>Things are easier with data. Say you have a package that has defined some list or
variable or some record, you can easily import that package, and iterate through
that list or use the variable, and create your custom visualisations etc. This
part of FTD/FPM is working well already.</p>

<p>When we are writing software we do not start from scratch, we take existing
libraries and build on top of them. When writing on the other hand, say a book, we
somehow live in the world where the assumption is every last word must be written
or well its not a book.</p>
<p>It is not like we do not have open licensing available today for prose and creative
writing. Creative Commons is out there. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Copyrights">Wikipedia</a>
is successful project using Creative Commons. Github today has <a href="https://github.com/search?q=license%3Acc&type=Repositories&ref=advsearch&l=&l=">147,082 Creative
Commons repositories</a>.</p>
<p>Even software documentation like Django documentation, is available in permissible
license, even though it is not Creative Commons. Significant number of open source
software ships with documentation, and usually that documentation is available in
permissive licenses.</p>
<p>So we have <em>huge</em> amount of content available today. And yet we almost never see
the content being “remixed”. Work being built on top of existing stuff. Everyone
writing a new book on say Python feels they must start from scratch.</p>
<p>This I believe is bad for the world. We may think like we have a lot of books but
we do not have enough books written. I once tried to write “Python for PHP
Developers” and I got quite a good response on Reddit etc. We do not have enough
intermediate level books.</p>
<p>But much worse than books, the real problem is ironically still too many books.
Like say you are an intern and you want to join FifthTry, you will have to learn
Rust, but then also Diesel, and PostgreSQL. And yes Django. And possibly even Elm.
Some JavaScript. Some CSS. And of course enough about Linux, and AWS? And this is
assuming they do not have to learn any FifthTry specific stuff. Which they still
have to. What is FTD? How we deploy our services, how we do things and so forth.</p>
<p>Imagine there was a great book written about each of these topics, am I supposed to
hand that many books to an intern who joins us? Maybe not all of them but it still
many books.</p>
<p>How about if there was just one book? Think about it. Do we really need to learn
whole of Django? Of course not, we only use Django for database modelling and
migrations, so they must not actually read about django views and admin and
template and so on. If you think about it telling an intern to learn any of them
is itself really hard. How much of Rust should they know? How do you even talk
about it? Every team that uses Rust uses a different aspect of Rust.</p>
<p>Should you learn about things that’s not directly pertinent to your job, the exact
task? Of course learning is never bad, but we have only so much time, and if you
not smart about it you may end up spending too much of your precious learning time
learning things that may not be used for the job at the expense of other stuff that
you will need. Knowledge acquisition simply can not be done in depth first fashion,
since it’s a bottom less pit.</p>
<p>In summary we want people to be able to create books or dedicated websites for
learning something, or compilation of information, knowledge, data etc, by using
other packages as dependencies. This can allow “knowledge curators” to create
learning paths for specific audiences.</p>

<p>Me and Arpita worked further on the design of translation UI. Check out <a href="https://github.com/FifthTry/fpm/commit/20e709dfb5f30cae9db33d3ca2b97357c4fc3872">this
commit</a>
to see the basic skeleton of our design.</p>
<p>The key idea is now we will have multiple base HTML files, <code>with-fallback.html</code>
and <code>with-message.html</code>, which will be created with content of more than one FTD
documents. For example <code>with-message.html</code> will render a “message document” and
a “main document”. Further, individual documents can be shown and hidden using
basic DOM style manipulation (<code>display: none</code> etc).</p>
<p>We are going to need a new feature in FTD, <a href="/ftd/~/127/">“message-host”</a>, which
will allow an event handler to message the “ftd host” (also in future we are going
to rename FTD “Library” terminology to “FTD Host”).</p>
<p>Our <code>with-fallback.html</code> will come with a <code>show_main()</code> and <code>show_fallback()</code> host
messages that our “message ftd” file will be able to trigger using <code>$event-click$: message-host show-main</code> etc.</p>
<p>We are quite happy with this design for now. I wrote couple of feature requests
that can be implemented using this: <a href="/fpm/~/32/">“banner support”</a> and <a href="/fpm/~/33/">encryption
support</a>.</p>

<p>A relatively strong consideration for designing translation, especially translation
of versioned packages is that “translation can not alter logical content” rule.
Consider <code>1.0/intro.txt</code> vs <code>1.1/intro.txt</code>. Consider a question: who decides if
<code>1.1/intro.txt</code> must exist? Original package only, or can translation package also
decide this? Is it possible that in original we only have <code>1.0/intro.txt</code> and no
<code>1.1/intro.txt</code>, which means as per the maintainers of original package, who
supposedly are working closest with the actual software being translated, as per
them there is no need for <code>1.1/intro.txt</code>, that there is no software change between
<code>1.0</code> and <code>1.1</code> such that <code>intro.txt</code> content changes. But can translation
maintainers take overwrite this call and still decide to have <code>1.1/intro.txt</code>?</p>
<p>What if the original <code>1.0/intro.txt</code> had only so much content and translation team
not only translated but decided to expand the intro and cover more topics in the
intro? If they do then original and translated intro have logically diverged. It
would then not be accurate to say that this is just a translation, it is not an
independent work which was derived from the original.</p>
<p>I am not saying logical changes, derivative work shouldn’t be allowed, just that
one should be aware when they are doing it. Some authors may be okay with their
work being translated “faithfully” in other languages, but may not like their work
editorialised or “improved upon” by others (and sold / marketed in the original
author’s name). I as an author may not be able to read how you have altered my work
in Chinese or some, so how can I as an author endorse it? I don’t even know what’s
in it, maybe the change is minor but its really hard to say what is minor and what
is not. A little thing the translator decided to omit as its too early to mention
this feature, maybe the reason people would not buy that product because the author
knew that that feature must be mentioned earlier as author knows the audience
better than the translator.</p>
<p>Bottom line is there should be a clean line between translation and derivative
work. And authors should be allowed to say they are okay with strict translation
and may not have energy to whet the “editorialisations” and may not want
derivative work.</p>
<p>So when we are talking about translation so far, we are talking about the stricter
translation, no logical changes, as faithful as vagaries of natural languages
allows one to be.</p>
<p>Let’s talk about tracking now. Tracking basically says “hey this document has
changed, and you said that document depends on this document, so maybe consider
updating that document”.</p>
<p>Now one can argue that tracking should not be allowed in translation packages. If
you want to be strict, you maybe tempted to say the only document a translated
document should be allowed to track is the corresponding document in original
package.</p>
<p>By and large I agree with assessment. There is one exception tho: what if say you
are also maintaining a “translated glossary”. This document may not exist in
original, but in every translation one must maintain a document that lists what’s
the translated term we are using for each interesting technical term in the
original language. If we start from scratch, two different translators can pick
two different ways to translate a term, and that may not be good for readers. So
this document should be present, and one can argue every document in the translated
package should be tracking the glossary file.</p>
<p>We are planning to implement a <a href="///www.fifthtry.com/fifthtry/ftd/~/9/">feature in
<code>ftd</code></a>, which can make this consideration
redundant though, do not put translated term in respective documents at all, but
refer to them from a common glossary file via ftd markup references so if
translation for a term changes all documents using that automatically get the
latest version.</p>
<p>Where does it leave us? Disallow tracking in translation packages?</p>

<p>So Arpita has heroically built the entire translation feature almost.
<code>fpm translation-status</code> is working. It looks for status of all documents in
original package by reviewing content of <code>.track</code> and shows status for each file
like “Never Marked”, “Update Date” etc.</p>
<p>TODO: Arpita to give me sample output of the command.</p>
<p>She has also implement fallback based build: if <code>django-hi/intro.ftd</code> doesn’t exist
we look for <code>django/intro.ftd</code>.</p>
<p>Next: We will build <code>fpm mark-upto-date</code> to keep updating translation status.</p>
<p>We also discussed if django has N dependencies do we auto include them in
<code>django-hi</code> if <code>django-hi</code> is a translation? Or should each translation mention
each dependency explicitly? For translation we may want to use the translation of
a dependency instead of the original package, and while doing so we would need to
be able to rename and keep using the same name.</p>
<p>Next we also have to add <code>language</code> in <code>fpm::Package</code>, and ensure that key is set
if current package is <code>translation-of</code> some “original package”. Original package
must also have the <code>language</code> set and the languages must be different. Also
<code>translation-of</code> can’t be “chained”, if this package is a translation of some other
package then no other package can translate this package, everyone must translate
the same package, each translation “cluster” has a single original translation
package that every package in that cluster is translating.</p>
<p>Finally we need to come to UI. We have a few scenarios, say translation doesn’t
exist for some document, in which case we have to show a message on top saying you
are seeing the English version because this document is not yet translated in
Hindi. Similarly we need UI for “never marked”, “out-of-date” and “upto date”.</p>
<p>We want people to be able to control these messages, these messages themselves must
be translated. We will have files <code>FPM/{missing, never-marked, out-of-date}.ftd</code>,
if they are not present we will have some fallback message. When creating a new
translation using a future <code>fpm create-translation</code> command we will auto create
these files maybe.</p>
<p>In never-marked and out-of-date scenarios we will have three FTD files to build,
which will go in the generated <code>.html</code> file. The “message” file will show on the
top of the page, and then one of the two, original and translation, would be shown
and the “message” file will have a button with an <code>$event-click$: call-js  &lt;function-name&gt;</code>, and we will have FPM.js file, which will have functions
<code>show-original</code> and <code>show-translation</code> (and a “client variable:
<code>fpm.showing-original</code>).</p>
<p>We will also need other server variables to be used when building “message” file
with variables like <code>original-language</code>, <code>translation-language</code>,
<code>translation-status: &quot;never marked&quot; etc</code>, <code>original-marked-on-date</code>,
<code>original-latest-date</code>, <code>original-diff</code> etc.</p>

<p>When referring to a document, we use a document id. The document id for a document
in current package is the relative path from package root. If we are referring to
a document from another package, we use <code>&lt;package-name&gt;:&lt;document-name&gt;</code>, the colon
separated path.</p>
<p>On its own if you see <code>x</code>, it can either be a document in current package, you may
ask why no <code>x.ftd</code>? Are we allowing <code>x/index.ftd</code> to be referred to by <code>x</code>? No. Our
<code>index.ftd</code> is only special at package root level, and not at individual folder
level, we follow <code>x.ftd</code> and <code>x/y.ftd</code> convention and do not fall back to
<code>x/index.ftd</code>, <code>x/y.ftd</code> as say node etc do. There are advantages to fall back, eg
whole of <code>/x/*</code> is in a folder <code>x</code>, this leads to some simplicity, eg if you want
to ignore that path, you have to no ignore <code>x/</code> folder as well as <code>x.ftd</code> file.</p>
<p>We also have complications around import path in ftd documents vs file paths on
command line. If you want to import <code>x.ftd</code> you write <code>-- import: x</code>, without the
extension. Does that mean when you want to refer to <code>x.ftd</code> anywhere in FPM context
it must be <code>x</code>? Like on command line if you want to add tracking on <code>x.ftd</code> or sync
<code>x.ftd</code> do you use <code>x</code> or <code>x.ftd</code>?</p>
<p>We can have a rule, if only ftd file is meaningful in any context, eg in import
statement, you can not import a <code>.txt</code> file, but you can track <code>.txt</code> file, so if
only <code>.ftd</code> is allowed for something we use the path without <code>.ftd</code> extension and
any file can be passed we use the extension.</p>
<p>We can also standardise on file vs document terminology. Document in FPM context
strictly means it is a FTD file, where as file means any file. So function names,
parameters etc can use <code>print_file()</code> or <code>print_document()</code> etc naming convention.</p>
<p>There is one more complexity. Say you have a <code>logo.png</code> file, there can also be a
<code>logo.png.ftd</code> file which contains the meta data or web index of the <code>logo.png</code>. We
can argue that this is too much complexity and lets have no such special
convention. For example this causes another complexity as to what should be the URL
of such <code>logo.png.ftd</code> file? The URL of <code>logo.png</code> is <code>/logo.png</code> if it is at
package root, but for <code>x.ftd</code> the URL is <code>/x/</code> so with this logic the URL of
<code>logo.png.ftd</code> would be <code>/logo.png/</code>, and having different content based on
presence or absence of a trailing <code>/</code> in URL seems to be a bad idea. Or maybe we do
it based on “accept” header, if you request an HTML for <code>/logo.png</code> you get the
content of <code>logo.png.ftd</code> and if you request image you get the <code>.png</code>. But then how
would you link to the file? Say you want to open an image in a new tab?</p>

<p><code>fpm</code> cli currently is littered with <code>println()</code> and <code>eprintln()</code> calls all over
the place. This works okay if we assume that output will always be on terminal, but
we want to support JSON output as well. Also even if we did not want to, in
general this is bad software design as if the code on how to show output is spread
over the entire crate then its harder to modify it, test it etc.</p>
<p>What we should do instead if each of the commands that we have must have a
corresponding output type define. Currently we return just a success indicator, and
the return is returned as some custom error type, which in general sounds good but
has no provision for warnings etc, say if you are building <code>cp</code> someone asked you
to copy 10 files and you failed to copy the last file, should you only get the
<code>Err</code> part, then you will have to stuff information about the files that were
successfully parsed inside <code>Err</code>, or you say if even one file was successful then
we return <code>Ok</code>.</p>
<p>This is just mis-using <code>Result</code>. We can use <code>Result::Err</code> to indicate something
really bad has gone wrong, we could not proceed at all, say the command you tried
to execute does not exist, or the config file is not found. But all other wrong,
eg a given FTD file has bad syntax or could not be read due to permission issues,
we should send all as <code>Result::Ok</code>.</p>
<p>Further we should have a type for each command which represents the output, which
can be printed out on stdout with colour highlighting or converted to JSON etc.
Also, <code>main()</code> should do the print to stdout or convert to json etc and not
individual command handler functions.</p>

<p>Been looking at code and found a struct <code>fpm::document::Document</code>. Not too happy
with its design right now.</p>
<p>The idea is we have a lot of commands, and many of these commands go through
all the documents in the current package, and <code>fpm::document::Document</code> and the
corresponding <code>get_documents()</code> gives you a vector of these documents for easier
time handling all files. The main job this <code>get_documents()</code> is abstracting over
the directory walking so you do not have to worry about anything and you can just
do a <code>for d in get_documents()</code>. Another thing <code>get_documents()</code> takes care of is
ignoring documents that should not be handled, eg <code>.history</code>, <code>.track</code>, <code>.build</code>
etc special folders.</p>
<p>I was thinking about what’s bothering so much about it. The first thought is
abstraction and frameworks. I kind of am not fond of them, unless there is a strong
reason. It like a trade, you want to have a nice Mercedes, sure, go ahead, you just
have to pay for it. You cant just wish it. If you want to create a framework you
have to understand all future needs. You have to educate people, it must be well
documented. There must be abstraction boundaries. Everyone must understand what
this framework is doing etc etc. People look at framework and go say I will also
make one. But I will do all the work later. If you wonder where tech debt comes
from, this is where it comes from. You went to a Mercedes showroom and drove off
with a shiny car, and told them you will pay for it later. Live with your ballgadi
instead.</p>

Also instead of framework - a
full on abstraction over file system, as that is what the <code>fpm::document</code> module
is trying to be, an abstraction over file system so you do not have to deal with
file system API - we should think of use cases and write helper methods.</p>
<p>Let’s see what all we need? We need to know if the given path is ftd document or
markdown or some static file. Further want to know if some path is top level,
in-fact there is only one such use case, we only do one special handling, the
top level <code>index.ftd</code> maps to <code>index.html</code>, every other <code>.ftd</code> maps to
<code>&lt;without-extension/index.html</code>. Further during processing we want to report
relative path of every document being processed, with respect to current directory.</p>
<p>Another thing we need is some sort of expectation if we are running from the
package root directory or any random path inside it. We want to support the later
case so none of the function should be written with respect to the assumption that
they are running from package root directory. Either that or we assume everything
is running from package root and we do a chdir at the start of the program. If we
do change directory then we still need to keep track of which directory we were
called from so that during reporting we show the relative paths.</p>
<p>We also need to be able to process the subset of a directory, either the current
directory or a directory whose path was specified on the command line. So whatever
directory walker we need, need that ability.</p>
<p>Further we want to sometime process files from another package, say in case of
translation, we want to walk the original package and find corresponding files in
current package. That too we would want to do starting from an arbitrary folder, eg
the folder corresponding to current dir in the original package (eg if package root
is <code>foo</code> and you are in currently in <code>foo/a/b</code>, and original is <code>foo-en</code>, then we
want to traverse all files in <code>.packages/foo-en/a/b/</code>).</p>

assume that if it was possible to check validity of <code>X</code> it must have been checked
by <code>constructor()</code> and they can blindly trust the output of <code>constructor()</code>. The
only exception to this is “expensive check scenarios” where its not feasible for
<code>constructor()</code> to check everything as that check would be too expensive and
detrimental to performance of the program. Note that in such cases the
documentation of <code>constructor()</code> must say so, what checks have been left out, and
there must be some <code>X.deep_check()</code> or something that will perform the rest of the
expensive checks`.</p>

components exposed as some other package? What if any package can act as an
“interface”, and any other package can “implement” it?</p>
<p>We actually do not want to do anything special to declare that some package is an
interface. Every package is an interface. Just that they are not well known, others
are not going to “implement” that package. But any package can become popular and
others can start targeting that package.</p>
<p>When you are creating a package and implementing an interface, for that matter a
package should be able to implement more than one interface if they happen to be
mutually non-conflicting. Two packages would be “conflicting” if say both exposed
a component “heading”, but they take different parameters. Or maybe one uses
<code>heading</code> as a type (say a record name or variable name) and the other has a
component named <code>heading</code>.</p>
<p>Now imagine there was some well-known package, <code>fifthtry/blog</code> for example, and
then a package can declare that they implement <code>fifthtry/blog</code> by using
<code>implements:</code> package key:</p>

protocol</a>, LSP, supported
today by many editors, we must have some sort of language documentation protocol.
Not protocol maybe, as that implies a network protocol, we should have some
standard file system, package format or whatever, for where to get documentation
from.</p>
<p>So say we create <code>fifthtry/pydocs</code> package interface for documenting python
packages, or maybe even more specific <code>fifthtry/python-cli</code> vs
<code>python/django-app</code> etc. And so on for all programming languages.</p>
<p>We then create tooling to extract source docs from python etc packages and update
the docs. So you have your python source checked out in a folder, and next to it
you have the docs checked out, and there is a tool that extracts all source docs
from python and updates the docs. And then there is another tool that does the
reverse, takes the docs from the docs folder and updates the python files.</p>
<p>This is sort of literate programming in reverse. You edit docs in source files
and extract docs out of it, and then modify the extracted docs and put them back
in. Javadocs etc do only one step, take out the docs from the source, but they do
not put things back in.</p>

source code to fetch the source, then fetch the documentation package in the users

<p>Of course, you would want to do this only in development builds, in a production
environment you do not need to do the extra work, nor do you want to mess with line
numbers in source code so all error stack traces are consistent.</p>
<p>This is basically a hack. Ideally, editors should be updated to support the
documentation package format itself and show tooltips docs from DPF files instead
of the source file. During development, we do use jump to definition, and often
scroll to read the docs, so patching source is also needed.</p>

<p><code>.info</code> file will also contain the “commit message” of a change. And in future
when we implement history browsing it will also contain a flag that tells the UI
to ignore this particular change saying it’s a minor thing and is distracting. We
don’t actually delete the timestamp file and merge because timestamps are created
on sync and after sync it gets published, and others may have stored that timestamp
in their <code>.track</code> file.</p>
<p>Technically, we can manage to miss <code>.timestamp</code> files from a <code>.track</code> file by
using the immediate previous entry, but it will cause a double review in edge
cases. I prefer we never delete the history.</p>

<p>When things are rendered via <code>fpm-repo</code> things are fine, but when using <code>fpm build</code>,
things can become a problem if the package size or complexity grows. With support
for HTTP request handling and SQLite queries, and we will be adding a lot of stuff,
we are just getting started, the time it takes <code>fpm build</code> may start becoming an
issue.</p>
<p>One way to speed things could be to do build caching, do not rebuild something that
has no change. Consider the simple case, <code>a.ftd</code>, which does not import any other
document. Consider also we do not have dynamic features like <code>fpm.now</code> which
returns the current time. In such cases, we can choose to not rebuild <code>a.ftd</code> if
the content of <code>a.ftd</code> hasn’t changed.</p>
<p>We can detect if a document uses another document or dynamic features, and we can
store this information, and use it when to decide if we should rebuild things or
not. Eg, if we know some document has used <code>fpm.now</code> and has no other dependency and
that document’s content hasn’t changed, we still want to regenerate the
corresponding html, as <code>fpm.now</code> returns a different value on every run.</p>
<p>We can do this optimisation for <code>sqlite</code> as well if a random sqlite file has been
used. If the sqlite database file has changed then we need to rebuild the document
that queries that sqlite database even if the document itself hasn’t changed.</p>
<p>But when we talk about query against package database, a sqlite database that we
would be creating/updating based on the content of all documents in an fpm package,
that sqlite will always change, and any document that queries that package database
can never be cached.</p>
<p>Unless we break the package database into smaller databases, say for each record
we have a sqlite file, and some document is only interested in instances of that
record, and we know that only a few files have created an instance of that record,
now the out of date graph would be a lot smaller, only those few files.</p>
<p>Smaller files have problems tho, some queries would want to use join and if the
tables in different database join may not always be possible (not sure how things
would be after the support of referring multiple sqlite databases for a single
query, can it negate this drawback?). Not sure how foreign key would work etc.</p>
<p>One thing is there that we can do both, generate big databases and individual
databases as well, and do it opportunistically, only generate the databases that
were referred by any of the documents. This way we can even choose to not generate
the big package database if no document is querying that database.</p>
<p>How about a database for use for other packages? Say <code>package a</code> wants to query
database of <code>package b</code>? That is slightly simpler because then you are not worrying
about build time but sync or publish time. It may be okay to do more work during
publishing.</p>
<p>But then again why are we calling build all the time? Why are we worried about
performance of the build at all? Because we currently do not support auto reload?</p>
<p>Auto reload means we have to support the demand generation of pages, in which
case we don’t have to worry about caching, the moment we introduce support for
<code>fpm server</code>, even without auto reload feature, this whole discussion would go
moot.</p>
<p>Making <code>fpm build</code> fast would be important, but then we can ignore it as it’s no
longer urgent, as so far my concern was author edit workflow, which would be

Shobhit
has added support for handling static files (files other than ftd and markdown, and
not ignored by <code>.gitignore</code>/<code>fpm.ignore</code> etc).</p>
<p>Now we can add images etc as part of an FPM package and they get included in
generated static site.</p>
<p>Since we kind of now include all files in the current directory, it may be a good
idea to review the files that are being processed and ignore files you do not want
published, both for performance and security reasons.</p>

code is accidentally copying say <code>/etc/passwd</code> to the built file. This can happen
say if we started support symlinks, and someone has a package that you are
contributing to, and symlink gets you to accidentally copy more stuff to <code>.build</code>
and publish to the world.</p>
<p>It can happen more than by just symlink, say in <code>$processor$: package-query</code>, if
the value of <code>db</code> is set to say <code>../firefox-password-store.sqlite</code> file, again we
may accidentally read beyond what we should, which is the content of the current
package or any package that is a direct dependency of this package. In fact, if
current package depends and a package <code>a</code> and <code>a</code> depends on <code>b</code>, then we must not
allow current package files to directly reference files in <code>b</code> without adding an
explicit dependency on <code>b</code>, as while this is technically not a security issue, it
causes issues if <code>a</code> removes the dependency, the package will suddenly stop
building.</p>
<p>We are shipping a binary that runs on people’s machines, this is a threat vector,
and while its easy to audit code for direct threats (attempt to do mining, or
scanning stuff), we are also letting our binary download packages from the internet
authored by others, and we have to give guarantees that those files can not do
any harm either.</p>
<p>Our FTD must not get any feature, for instance, letting people directly execute
commands from a package, without user understanding the command (this can happen
when a package is being downloaded for the first time, we should show all the
external commands this fpm package is going to be able to run etc).</p>
<p>The thing is this is very tricky, we can not say we don’t want to let package
authors run anything, that will significantly decrease the power of FPM packages.
We have to allow people to query data from their trusted data stores, to make it
part of generated documents, <em>if they want to</em>. But we can not surprise people.
Even HTTP requests are sensitive, not just command execution.</p>

the <code>fpm tracks destination source</code> syntax. We should make it maybe:
<code>fpm start-tracking &lt;f1&gt; --target &lt;f2&gt;</code>. Also the code assumes we will only track
<code>ftd</code> files, but we have to be able to track any file. Remove <code>.ftd</code> prefix
handling.</p>
<p><code>fpm mark-upto-date &lt;f1&gt; --target &lt;f2&gt;</code>. Here target would be optional eventually,
if the target was missing and <code>f1</code> tracks more than one file then the cli would
prompt which file.</p>

already being tracked it should show some message.</p>

diff, or should we have a separate command.</p>

solution for storing documentation, in my opinion. Traditional “source code
managers” create a new folder or a branch for managing versioning.</p>
<p>Say you are working on django 1.0 and its time to create django 2.0, you create a
new branch for version 2.0 and start working on it.</p>
<p>At this point, the two branches have diverged. All new changes now go to the 2.0
branch. You may even make main or master follow the 2.0 branch. For all practical
reasons, 1.0 has stopped. You will want to be good citizens and support 1.0,
backport some of the bug fixes, especially security fixes. In projects like Linux
people even backport whole features to older versions.</p>
<p>But back-porting is kind of extra work. Most people recommend and send a pull
request against the latest main/master and the changes get included in the next
release that is cut from main/master.</p>

You have to verify software
indeed works correctly. You have to write unit tests and verify there are no
regressions. Software releases and continuous maintenance is work. It’s kind of
usually best to focus efforts on the latest version and update as soon as one can.</p>
<p>Documentation on the other hand is lot easier. There is no risk of documentation
breaking anything. Wrong documentation can still have consequences, no doubt about
it, but they are rather rare, compared to software issues. Software is a lot more
fragile compared to documentation.</p>
<p>By managing documentation like the software we are doing a dis-service. It’s the
wrong tool for the job.</p>
<p>One difference in documentation compared to software is that a lot of changes in
documentation are not logical. Eg, if the original documentation said this function
takes three arguments and the new one says it takes four, this is a logical
difference. But if the original documentation was too terse, and new documentation
gives more examples and explanations and how-tos, the documentation hasn’t really
changed in a logical sense.</p>
<p>It’s like refactor in software. We know refactor, should not cause any change in
behaviour of the software. But in software it’s really hard to arrive at this
conclusion, if someone sends a software refactor PR, it’s really hard to say that
will really have no effect, that it’s safe to merge.</p>
<p>But for documentation its almost trivial to see a PR and conclude that there is
no real “logical” change, that it is just a better written tutorial and has not
changed anything fundamental.</p>

doesn’t copy, but that’s a git’s internal detail, from human operator/user
perspective it is a copy), we must have a single folder with all versions, one
folder for each version. But when creating a new version, we must not copy content
of the current version, we must create an <strong>empty</strong> folder and rely on fallback
logic at documentation build time to fill in the files from the last versions.</p>
<p>For this we create a sparse tree, each version folder only contains a file if that
file is <strong>logically</strong> divergent from the corresponding file in the previous
version. One can even store just the diff, and maybe that is what we will end up
doing, but from data structure perspective thinking as if we have only stored the
diff is the right way to think about what I am suggesting.</p>
<p>With this requirement to only copy when there is a logical change, the number of
copies would go down, and humans can easily review if the change is indeed logical.
For that matter, humans may also realise that the change in the software itself
can be tweaked so this logical change is not needed (I mean if you are changing
something you are forcing every user of your library to learn something new, and
if with a small amount of effort you can ensure that no change is needed, no need
for hundreds and thousands of users to learn something new, isn’t that small effort
worth it? And it’s not just users you are helping, if you have to maintain one less
diverged file, it will reduce the overall work you have to do in the lifetime of

<p>Yesterday I <a href="https://github.com/FifthTry/fpm/commit/3c2662a6797495c7ead4b7b3bb9c431616b1bf00">started implementing SQLite
support</a>
for FTD documents via <code>$processor$</code> mechanism of <code>ftd</code>. It was stuck on some
missing helper utilities in FTD, you can see the two functions at the end with
<code>todo!()</code> as their body.</p>
<p>Today Arpita is feeling a bit better from the cold, and she has created <a href="https://github.com/FifthTry/ftd/pull/24">PR
implementing those functions in ftd</a>. She
can’t not work even when down it seems!</p>
<p>On that change landed I got the <a href="https://github.com/FifthTry/fpm/commit/89d8ba1d1d5f93b5f8b58e306dd8b6b8965f1fb5"><code>$processor$: package-query</code>
working</a>.
Update the <a href="/fpm/package-query/">documentation</a> as well.</p>
<p>During implementation, I found out that <a href="https://docs.rs/rusqlite/0.26.1/rusqlite/types/trait.FromSql.html#impl-FromSql-for-Value"><code>serde-json</code> support for
rusqlite</a> is
actually, umm, not sure what word to use, not buggy per se, but kind of not as
useful as I first thought it would be. It converts only the text field to
<code>serde_json::Value</code>, when other fields like integer, float etc can also be easily
converted to <code>serde_json::Value</code>. I implemented a <a href="https://github.com/FifthTry/fpm/blob/53492bb14f16983569184f0acfd9c1f45ddf1c32/src/library/sqlite.rs#L102-L108">simple converter for other
sqlite data types as well</a>.</p>
<p>We are not done yet. We need the ability to pass parameters to queries. Also, those
parameters should be able to refer to other ftd variables. And finally, we should
be able to read into more types, currently, we only read into records and a list of
records.</p>

We are going to soon
implement “ad hoc tracking”, basically a <code>.track</code> folder that contains <code>foo.track</code>
like file for each <code>foo.ftd</code> file. <code>status</code>/<code>diff</code> will look into the <code>.track</code> file
for any file and see if they are up to date with respect to the files being
tracked.</p>
<p>Once we have ad-hoc tracking, we are going to work on translation tracking, where
a package would be able to designate itself to be a translation of another package
using <code>translation-of</code> key in <code>FPM.ftd</code>. When a package tracks another package like
this it means two things.</p>

all files of original would be the content of the translation package. And then
you can start translating one file at a time by copying over just that file, so you
do not have to litter your package with files that are just plain copies.</p>

the corresponding file in original package, translation is complete for that file,
but what if it’s not up to date? Or even it was never finished? What if you just
created the translation file, have only translated the heading, what should we show
in those cases?</p>
<p>So far, given a file <code>a.ftd</code>, we convert it to <code>a.html</code> and that’s it. But now for
a file <code>translated:a.ftd</code> we have <code>original:a.ftd</code>. So we have to consider two
files when generating <code>a.html</code>. In simple case, where <code>translated:a.ftd</code> is “up to
date”, we render <code>translated:a.ftd</code> and that is that. But if <code>translated:a.ftd</code> is
missing or not up to date, we have to include the content of both (and two
potential diffs, diff of <code>original:a.ftd</code> from the date <code>translated:a.ftd</code> was last
marked up to date by a human being, to the latest <code>original:a.ftd</code>, and diff of
<code>translated:a.ftd</code> when and if it was marked updated date last to latest).</p>
<p>So we have two ftd files and two diffs, and possibly some metadata to include in
the generated <code>a.html</code>. We also need some JS to let people switch between
potentially out of date or incomplete translation and the original version. And we
need an area to show some out of date warnings, and some UI to show/hide the two
diffs.</p>

<code>.html</code> file, we have to ask ourselves if we should split our UI into two logical
area, an area completely controlled by end user using ftd, and another for the
special stuff, like translation out of date messaging?</p>
<p>Tomorrow we will have more stuff, like when we add versioning support, we would
want to show “you are looking at the old version, jump to the latest version” eg
docs.rs etc, but then if you are seeing a specific version, you want to see two
diffs as well: diff of what changed in this precise release, so diff from the last
version to this version, and diff of this version with the latest version. It would
be good if these two bits of info were available at a fingertip without doing
complex git diff incantations.</p>
<p>For both versioning and translation, we need to show some sort of “switcher”, go to
another language or version of this document.</p>
<p>We can do these by special variables. We can expect each “theme” to know about
these special variables, and the theme author can include the UI in the most
logical place.</p>
<p>We can also create a dedicated “document info” area, say a banner at the top, and
then theme does not need to bother with all that.</p>
<p>We can even let people customise say <code>FPM/document-info.ftd</code> file whose content
would be included in the special area.</p>
<p>And finally, we can let these writers specify that they have indeed included the
document info in the theme itself and <code>fpm</code> should not show
<code>FPM/document-info.ftd</code>, maybe we inherit <code>FPM/document-info</code> from the theme and
let the theme set it to an empty file?</p>
<p>There is a little complexity when an FTD document basically says unload me and load
some other document. We do not have an FTD way to do this yet. Not sure if it’s a
good idea.</p>
<p>The thing is this is a lot of complexity and a lot of potential changes, at least
in the early days, leaving it for each theme to individually manage would be a bad
idea as then the confidence with which you can switch theme will go down as you
will have to verify more things, and not just the look and feel of a theme.</p>

fledged <a href="///www.fifthtry.com/fpm/~/20/">“dynamic”/data drive documents</a>. To really
expose this feature, we can implement arbitrary URL handing, currently only the
URLs corresponding to actual FTD files is available, this is too limiting as we can
not have author page for example, where we need a URL for each author, and author
list maybe in a table, or spread all over ftd documents.</p>
<p>With a <code>FPM/URLs.ftd</code>, we can define URL patterns that can contain dynamic data, eg
<code>/&lt;username&gt;/</code> etc. We can map each URL pattern to a FTD file, and the file can
extract the data by defining a schema (eg a record), where the fields of record
would be populated by URL query parameters, URL fragments (eg <code>username</code>) here, or
even request body if its available.</p>
<p>We will sometime need redirect etc, eg if you need login to access something, or
if the page has moved etc. So we need a mechanism to early return, currently its
not possible in a FTD document to let a document say we are done processing the
page. At least we can have some standard variable, eg <code>fpm.redirect-url</code>, which
when set, FPM will ignore the document and return the content of <code>fpm.redirect-url</code>
instead, along with some instruction to <code>fpm.js</code> to update the URL displayed in
browser.</p>
<p>This is almost the design of <a href="///www.amitu.com/realm/"><code>realm</code></a>. Once I wrote that
I realised we also need an equivalent of “realm actions”, and turned out the design
is really easy. Wrote about it in another CR: <a href="///www.fifthtry.com/fpm/~/24/">fpm
actions</a>.</p>
<p>The key element of actions is now we need a <code>fpm.js</code>, which will have some
behaviour, and this paves the way for <a href="///www.fifthtry.com/fpm/~/25/">fpm client

<p>Arpita has been on fire, implemented these three commands. This makes <code>fpm</code> puts
some “version control” features in <code>fpm</code>. Our goal is not become simplified git,
we definitely take a lot of inspiration from them, but more like advance
Dropbox/iCloud.</p>
<p><code>fpm repo</code> is needed before we can really call ourselves version control or compare
ourselves with Dropbox/iCloud etc. But if you are using Dropbox/iCloud, you can
already benefit from these commands.</p>
<p>Our goal now is to implement <a href="/fpm/~/12/"><code>adhoc tracking</code></a>, and get to
<a href="/fpm/~/3/"><code>translation tracking</code></a>.</p>

<p>We implemented <a href="/fpm/processors/">these two processors</a>. TOC processor helps you
when you are trying to create navigation bars, or table of content of your FPM
site (this is not the intra page TOC, which we still do not know how to implement).</p>
<p><code>$processor$: http</code> lets you fetch data from any HTTP endpoint that returns JSON
when rendering a FTD document. It opens up massive opportunities, you can fetch
data from all sorts of places, data driven graphs and tables etc can be created.</p>

<p>Wrote about the design of <a href="/fpm/~/16/">package database</a>, basically a sqlite
database that we will maintain in the initial phase of <code>fpm build</code>, and a way to
query that database to get data stored in different ftd documents that are part
of the FPM package.</p>
<p>This can make fpm packages the ideal data sharing format. You can have data
authored in FTD, and packaged as FPM package, along with some UI code, and publish
them to <code>fpm repo</code>. And then other packages can have a dependency on the original
data package, fpm will download the data, and they can do something more with it,
create more visualisations, augment data even more using <code>$processors$</code> etc, and
maybe publish that package again for other to consume.</p>

<p>We have started working on this project now. We have written design docs for quite
a few elements:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>fpm build</code>: <a href="/fpm/~/1/">file system organization</a></li>
<li><a href="/fpm/~/2/">logical linking</a></li>
<li><a href="/fpm/~/3/">translation tracking</a></li>
<li><a href="/fpm/~/5/">version tracking</a></li>
<li><a href="/fpm/~/4/">history tracking</a></li>
<li><a href="/fpm/~/6/">cr tracking</a></li>
<li><a href="/fpm/~/7/">upstream tracking: two way sync</a></li>
<li><a href="/fpm/~/8/"><code>fpm-repo</code> authentication</a></li>
<li><a href="/fpm/~/9/">package dependencies</a></li>
<li><a href="/fpm/~/10/">access control</a></li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://github.com/sharmashobit">Shobhit</a> is taking the lead of implementing this.
We are hoping to create a minimal version that can convert ftd files to HTML so
<code>fpm</code> can be considered an alternative to static site generators.</p>
